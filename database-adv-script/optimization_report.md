Explanation
Initial Query:

The initial query retrieves all bookings along with user details, property details, and payment details using JOIN operations.
The EXPLAIN command is used to analyze the queryâ€™s performance and identify any inefficiencies.
Analyze Performance:

The EXPLAIN command provides information about the query execution plan, including the indexes used, join methods, and estimated row counts.
Look for any full table scans, unnecessary joins, or missing indexes that could be causing performance issues.
Refactor the Query:

Create indexes on high-usage columns to improve join performance.
idx_booking_user_id: Index on the user_id column in the Booking table.
idx_booking_property_id: Index on the property_id column in the Booking table.
idx_payment_booking_id: Index on the booking_id column in the Payment table.
Refactored Query:

The refactored query is the same as the initial query but with added indexes to improve performance.
The EXPLAIN command is used again to verify the performance improvement after creating indexes.
Comments
The EXPLAIN command is crucial for understanding the query execution plan and identifying performance bottlenecks.
Creating indexes on high-usage columns can significantly improve the performance of JOIN operations.
The refactored query should show improved performance in terms of reduced execution
