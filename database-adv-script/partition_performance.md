Brief Report on Observed Improvements
Before Partitioning:

Queries on the large Booking table were slow, especially when filtering by date ranges.
Full table scans were often required, leading to poor performance.
After Partitioning:

By partitioning the Booking table based on the start_date column, the database can more efficiently manage and query the data.
Queries filtering by date ranges now benefit from partition pruning, where the database only scans relevant partitions.
Performance improvements were observed in the EXPLAIN output, showing reduced scan times and more efficient query execution plans.
Conclusion:

Partitioning the Booking table based on the start_date column significantly improved query performance for date range queries.
This approach is particularly beneficial for large datasets where traditional indexing may not be sufficient to optimize query performance.
