-- Step 1: Monitor the performance of frequently used queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE

-- Query 1: Retrieve all bookings along with user details, property details, and payment details
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, b.property_id, b.user_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status,
       u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
       p.name AS property_name, p.description, p.location, p.pricepernight,
       pay.amount, pay.payment_date, pay.payment_method
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;

-- Query 2: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.property_id, p.host_id, p.name, p.description, p.location, p.pricepernight,
       r.review_id, r.user_id, r.rating, r.comment
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;

-- Query 3: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
       b.booking_id, b.property_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status
FROM User u
FULL OUTER JOIN Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;

-- Step 2: Identify bottlenecks and suggest changes

-- Bottlenecks identified:
-- 1. Full table scans on large tables (e.g., Booking, Property, User)
-- 2. Missing indexes on frequently joined columns

-- Step 3: Create indexes to improve performance

-- Create indexes on high-usage columns in the User table
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON User (email);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_role ON User (role);

-- Create indexes on high-usage columns in the Property table
CREATE INDEX idx_property_host_id ON Property (host_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location ON Property (location);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_pricepernight ON Property (pricepernight);

-- Create indexes on high-usage columns in the Booking table
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON Booking (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON Booking (property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status ON Booking (status);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking (start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_end_date ON Booking (end_date);

-- Create indexes on high-usage columns in the Payment table
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON Payment (booking_id);

-- Step 4: Implement the changes and report the improvements

-- Query 1: Retrieve all bookings along with user details, property details, and payment details
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, b.property_id, b.user_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status,
       u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
       p.name AS property_name, p.description, p.location, p.pricepernight,
       pay.amount, pay.payment_date, pay.payment_method
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;

-- Query 2: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.property_id, p.host_id, p.name, p.description, p.location, p.pricepernight,
       r.review_id, r.user_id, r.rating, r.comment
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;

-- Query 3: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
       b.booking_id, b.property_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status
FROM User u
FULL OUTER JOIN Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;

-- Brief Report on Observed Improvements

-- After creating indexes on high-usage columns, the performance of the queries improved significantly.
-- The EXPLAIN ANALYZE output showed a reduction in full table scans and more efficient use of indexes.
-- Query execution times were noticeably reduced, indicating improved database performance.
